      <p n="1">The method of presentation is associative and simultaneously construing.</p>
      <p n="2">For it, extensive quotations are fundamental.</p>
      <p n="3">I would like to communicate to the reader something of the perplexity that can be summoned through a pure reading—of course, in a prepared context.</p>
      <p n="4">The themes are relatively multifaceted; they are not pursued to their end anywhere.</p>
      <p n="5">Every chapter has to remain a hint.</p>
      <p n="6">Altogether, a methodically thought-out labyrinth results, as if we could gain knowledge of an epoch by going through texts from that time as through and between the mirrored walls of a carnival fun house.</p>
      <p n="7">Any other way would not succeed.</p>
      <p n="8">I want to make an object more comprehensible by showing how, in its own inner many-sidedness and fracturedness, it exceeds our normal powers of understanding.</p>
      <p n="9">What we need is a logical and historical “cubism,” a simultaneity in thinking and in seeing.</p>
      <p n="10">In daily life, we are not deranged enough to get a proper perspective on the derangement that has coagulated to normality of our everyday life and our history.</p>
